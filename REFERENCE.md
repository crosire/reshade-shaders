# Concepts

The ReShade FX shading language is heavily based on the DX9-style HLSL syntax, with a few extensions. For more details on HLSL, check out the Programming Guide: https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/direct3dhlsl/dx-graphics-hlsl-writing-shaders-9 .\
This document will instead primarily focus on syntax and features that are unique to ReShade FX.

### Macros

The ReShade FX compiler predefines certain preprocessor macros, as listed below:
* ``__FILE__`` Current file path
* ``__FILE_NAME__`` Current file name without path
* ``__FILE_STEM__`` Current file name without extension and path
* ``__LINE__`` Current line number
* ``__RESHADE__`` Version of the injector (in the format `MAJOR * 10000 + MINOR * 100 + REVISION`)
* ``__APPLICATION__`` 32-bit truncated Fnv1a hash of the application executable name
* ``__VENDOR__`` Vendor id (e.g. 0x10de for NVIDIA, 0x1002 for AMD)
* ``__DEVICE__`` Device id
* ``__RENDERER__`` Graphics API used to render effects
  * D3D9: 0x9000
  * D3D10: 0xa000 or higher
  * D3D11: 0xb000 or higher (e.g. 0xb100 for D3D11.1)
  * D3D12: 0xc000 or higher
  * OpenGL: 0x10000 or higher (e.g. 0x14300 for OpenGL 4.3)
  * Vulkan: 0x20000 or higher (e.g. 0x21100 for Vulkan 1.1)
* ``BUFFER_WIDTH`` Backbuffer width (essentially the width of the image the application renders to the screen)
* ``BUFFER_HEIGHT`` Backbuffer height
* ``BUFFER_RCP_WIDTH`` Reciprocal of the backbuffer width (equals `1.0 / BUFFER_WIDTH`)
* ``BUFFER_RCP_HEIGHT`` Reciprocal of the backbuffer height (equals `1.0 / BUFFER_HEIGHT`)
* ``BUFFER_COLOR_BIT_DEPTH`` Color bit depth of the backbuffer (8 or 10)
* ``BUFFER_COLOR_SPACE`` Color space type for presentation; 0 = unknown, 1 = sRGB, 2 = scRGB, 3 = HDR10 ST2084, 4 = HDR10 HLG.

Constructs like the following may be interpreted as a configurable UI option. To prevent this, the preprocessor define name can be prefixed with an underscore or made shorter or equal to 10 characters, in which case ReShade will not display it in the UI.
```hlsl
#ifndef MY_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINE
	#define MY_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINE 0
#endif
```

You can disable optimization during shader compilation by adding this line to an effect file:
```c
#pragma reshade skipoptimization
```

### Texture Object

> Textures are multidimensional data containers usually used to store images.

Annotations:

 * ``texture2D imageTex < source = "path/to/image.bmp"; > { ... };``  
 Opens image from the patch specified, resizes it to the texture size and loads it into the texture.\
 ReShade supports Bitmap (\*.bmp), Portable Network Graphics (\*.png), JPEG (\*.jpg), Targa Image (\*.tga) and DirectDraw Surface (\*.dds) files.

 * ``texture2D myTex1 < pooled = true; > { Width = 100; Height = 100; Format = RGBA8; };``  
 ``texture2D myTex2 < pooled = true; > { Width = 100; Height = 100; Format = RGBA8; };``  
 ReShade will attempt to re-use the same memory for textures with the same dimensions and format if the pooled annotation is set. This works across effect files too.

ReShade FX allows semantics to be used on texture declarations. This is used to request special textures:

 * ``texture2D texColor : COLOR;``  
 Receives the backbuffer contents (read-only).
 * ``texture2D texDepth : DEPTH;``  
 Receives the game's depth information (read-only).

Declared textures are created at runtime with the parameters specified in their definition body.

```hlsl
texture2D texColorBuffer : COLOR;
texture2D texDepthBuffer : DEPTH;

texture2D texTarget
{
	// The texture dimensions (default: 1x1).
	Width = BUFFER_WIDTH / 2;
	Height = BUFFER_HEIGHT / 2;
	
	// The number of mipmaps including the base level (default: 1).
	MipLevels = 1;
	
	// The internal texture format (default: RGBA8).
	// Available formats:
	//   R8, R16, R16F, R32F
	//   RG8, RG16, RG16F, RG32F
	//   RGBA8, RGBA16, RGBA16F, RGBA32F
	//   RGB10A2
	Format = RGBA8;

	// Unspecified properties are set to the defaults shown here.
};
```

### Sampler Object

> Samplers are the bridge between textures and shaders. They define how a texture is read from and how data outside texel coordinates is sampled. Multiple samplers can refer to the same texture using different options.

```hlsl
sampler2D samplerColor
{
	// The texture to be used for sampling.
	Texture = texColorBuffer;

	// The method used for resolving texture coordinates which are out of bounds.
	// Available values: CLAMP, MIRROR, WRAP or REPEAT, BORDER
	AddressU = CLAMP;
	AddressV = CLAMP;
	AddressW = CLAMP;

	// The magnification, minification and mipmap filtering types.
	// Available values: POINT, LINEAR
	MagFilter = LINEAR;
	MinFilter = LINEAR;
	MipFilter = LINEAR;

	// The maximum mipmap levels accessible.
	MinLOD = 0.0f;
	MaxLOD = 1000.0f;

	// An offset applied to the calculated mipmap level (default: 0).
	MipLODBias = 0.0f;

	// Enable or disable converting  to linear colors when sampling from the
	// texture.
	SRGBTexture = false;

	// Unspecified properties are set to the defaults shown here.
};

sampler2D samplerDepth
{
	Texture = texDepthBuffer;
};
sampler2D samplerTarget
{
	Texture = texTarget;
};
```

### Storage Object

> Storage objects define how a texture should be written to from compute shaders.

```hlsl
storage2D storageTarget
{
	// The texture to be used as storage.
	Texture = texTarget;
};
```

### Uniform Variables

> Global variables with the `uniform` qualifier are constant across each iteration of a shader per pass and may be controlled via the UI.

Annotations to customize UI appearance:

 * ui_type: Can be `input`, `drag`, `slider`, `combo`, `radio` or `color`
 * ui_min: The smallest value allowed in this variable (required when `ui_type = "drag"` or `ui_type = "slider"`)
 * ui_max: The largest value allowed in this variable (required when `ui_type = "drag"` or `ui_type = "slider"`)
 * ui_step: The value added/subtracted when clicking the button next to the slider
 * ui_items: A list of items for the combo box or radio buttons, each item is terminated with a `\0` character (required when `ui_type = "combo"` or `ui_type = "radio"`)
 * ui_label: Display name of the variable in the UI. If this is missing, the variable name is used instead.
 * ui_tooltip: Text that is displayed when the user hovers over the variable in the UI. Use this for a description.
 * ui_category: Groups values together under a common headline. Note that all variables in the same category also have to be declared next to each other for this to be displayed correctly.
 * ui_category_closed: Set to true to show a category closed by default.
 * ui_spacing: Adds space before the UI widget (multiplied by the value of the annotation).

Annotations are also used to request special runtime values (via the `source` annotation):

 * ``uniform float frametime < source = "frametime"; >;``  
 Time in milliseconds it took for the last frame to complete.
 * ``uniform int framecount < source = "framecount"; >;``  
 Total amount of frames since the game started.
 * ``uniform float4 date < source = "date"; >;``  
 float4(year, month (1 - 12), day of month (1 - 31), time in seconds)
 * ``uniform float timer < source = "timer"; >;``  
 Timer counting time in milliseconds since game start.
 * ``uniform float2 pingpong < source = "pingpong"; min = 0; max = 10; step = 2; smoothing = 0.0; >;``  
 Value that smoothly interpolates between `min` and `max` using `step` as the increase/decrease value every second (so a step value of 1 means the value is increased/decreased by 1 per second).\
 In this case it would go from 0 to 10 in 5 seconds and then back to 0 in another 5 seconds (interpolated every frame).
 The `smoothing` value affects the interpolation curve (0 is linear interpolation and anything else changes the speed depending on how close the current value is to `min` or `max`).
 The second component is either +1 or -1 depending on the direction it currently goes.
 * ``uniform int random_value < source = "random"; min = 0; max = 10; >;``  
 Gets a new random value between min and max every pass.
 * ``uniform bool space_bar_down < source = "key"; keycode = 0x20; mode = ""; >;``  
 True if specified keycode (in this case the spacebar) is pressed and false otherwise.
 If mode is set to "press" the value is true only in the frame the key was initially held down.
 If mode is set to "toggle" the value stays true until the key is pressed a second time.
 * ``uniform bool left_mouse_button_down < source = "mousebutton"; keycode = 0; mode = ""; >;``  
 True if specified mouse button (0 - 4) is pressed and false otherwise.
 If mode is set to "press" the value is true only in the frame the key was initially held down.
 If mode is set to "toggle" the value stays true until the key is pressed a second time.
 * ``uniform float2 mouse_point < source = "mousepoint"; >;``  
 Gets the position of the mouse cursor in screen coordinates.
 * ``uniform float2 mouse_delta < source = "mousedelta"; >;``  
 Gets the movement of the mouse cursor in screen coordinates.
 * ``uniform float2 mouse_value < source = "mousewheel"; min = 0.0; max = 10.0; > = 1.0;``  
 The first component value is modified via the mouse wheel. Starts at 1.0, goes up (but not past 10.0) when mouse wheel is moved forward and down (but not past 0.0) when it is moved backward.
 The second component holds the current wheel state (how much the mouse wheel was moved this frame). It's positive for forward movement, negative for backward movement or zero for no movement.
 * ``uniform bool has_depth < source = "bufready_depth"; >;``  
 True if the application's depth buffer is available in textures declared with `DEPTH`, false if not.
 * ``uniform bool overlay_open < source = "overlay_open"; >;``  
 True if the ReShade in-game overlay is currently open, false if not.
 * ``uniform int active_variable < source = "overlay_active"; >;``  
 Contains the one-based index of the uniform variable currently being modified in the overlay, zero if none.
 * ``uniform int hovered_variable < source = "overlay_hovered"; >;``  
 Contains the one-based index of the uniform variable currently hovered with the cursor in the overlay, zero if none.

```hlsl
// Initializers are used to specify the default value (zero is used if not specified).
uniform float4 UniformSingleValue = float4(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);

// It is recommended to use constants instead of uniforms if the value is not changing or user-configurable.
static const float4 ConstantSingleValue = float4(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);
```

### Structs

> Structs are user defined data types that can be used as types for variables. These behave the same as in HLSL.

```hlsl
struct MyStruct
{
	int MyField1, MyField2;
	float MyField3;
};
```

### Namespaces

> Namespaces are used to group functions and variables together, which is especially useful to prevent name clashing.
> The "::" operator is used to resolve variables or functions inside other namespaces.

```hlsl
namespace MyNamespace
{
	namespace MyNestedNamespace
	{
		void DoNothing()
		{
		}
	}

	void DoNothing()
	{
		MyNestedNamespace::DoNothing();
	}
}
```

### User functions

Parameter qualifiers:

 * ``in`` Declares an input parameter. Default and implicit if none is used. Functions expect these to be filled with a value.
 * ``out`` Declares an output parameter. The value is filled in the function and can be used in the caller again.
 * ``inout`` Declares a parameter that provides input and also expects output.

Supported flow-control statements:

 * ``if ([condition]) { [statement...] } [else { [statement...] }]``  
 Statements after if are only executed  if condition is true, otherwise the ones after else are executed (if it exists).
 * ``switch ([expression]) { [case [constant]/default]: [statement...] }``  
 Selects the case matching the switch expression or default if non does and it exists.
 * ``for ([declaration]; [condition]; [iteration]) { [statement...] }``  
 Runs the statements in the body as long as the condition is true. The iteration expression is executed after each run.
 * ``while ([condition]) { [statement...] }``  
 Runs the statements in the body as long as the condition is true.
 * ``do { [statement...] } while ([condition]);``  
 Similar to a normal while loop with the difference that the statements are executed at least once.
 * ``break;``  
 Breaks out  of the current loop or switch statement and jumps to the statement after.
 * ``continue;``  
 Jumps directly to the next loop iteration ignoring any left code in the current one.
 * ``return [expression];``  
 Jumps out of the current function, optionally providing a value to the caller.
 * ``discard;``  
 Abort rendering of the current pixel and step out of the shader. Can be used in pixel shaders only.

```hlsl
// Semantics are used to tell the runtime which arguments to connect between shader stages.
// They are ignored on non-entry-point functions (those not used in any pass below).
// Semantics starting with "SV_" are system value semantics and serve a special meaning.
// The following vertex shader demonstrates how to generate a simple fullscreen triangle with the three vertices provided by ReShade (http://redd.it/2j17wk):
void ExampleVS(uint id : SV_VertexID, out float4 position : SV_Position, out float2 texcoord : TEXCOORD0)
{
	texcoord.x = (id == 2) ? 2.0 : 0.0;
	texcoord.y = (id == 1) ? 2.0 : 0.0;
	position = float4(texcoord * float2(2, -2) + float2(-1, 1), 0, 1);
}

// The following pixel shader simply returns the color of the games output again without modifying it (via the "color" output parameter):
void ExamplePS0(float4 pos : SV_Position, float2 texcoord : TEXCOORD0, out float4 color : SV_Target)
{
	color = tex2D(samplerColor, texcoord);
}

// The following pixel shader takes the output of the previous pass and adds the depth buffer content to the right screen side.
float4 ExamplePS1(float4 pos : SV_Position, float2 texcoord : TEXCOORD0) : SV_Target
{
	// Here color information is sampled with "samplerTarget" and thus from "texTarget" (see sampler declaration above),
	// which was set as render target in the previous pass (see the technique definition below) and now contains its output.
	// In this case it is the game output, but downsampled to half because the texture is only half of the screen size.
	float4 color = tex2D(samplerTarget, texcoord);
	
	// Only execute the following code block when on the right half of the screen.
	if (texcoord.x > 0.5f)
	{
		// Sample from the game depth buffer using the "samplerDepth" sampler declared above.
		float depth = tex2D(samplerDepth, texcoord).r;
		
		// Linearize the depth values to better visualize them.
		depth = 2.0 / (-99.0 * depth + 101.0);
		
		color.rgb = depth.rrr;
	}

	return color;
}

// The following compute shader uses shared memory within a thread group:
groupshared int sharedMem[64];
void ExampleCS0(uint3 tid : SV_GroupThreadID)
{
	if (tid.y == 0)
		sharedMem[tid.x] = tid.x;
	barrier();
	if (tid.y == 0 && (tid.x % 2) != 0)
		sharedMem[tid.x] += sharedMem[tid.x + 1];
}

// The following compute shader writes a color gradient to the "texTarget" texture:
void ExampleCS1(uint3 id : SV_DispatchThreadID, uint3 tid : SV_GroupThreadID)
{
	tex2Dstore(storageTarget, id.xy, float4(tid.xy / float2(20 * 64, 2 * 8), 0, 1));
}
```

### Intrinsic functions

ReShade FX supports most of the standard HLSL intrinsics.\
Check out https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/direct3dhlsl/dx-graphics-hlsl-intrinsic-functions for reference on them:

> abs, acos, all, any, asfloat, asin, asint, asuint, atan, atan2, ceil, clamp, cos, cosh, cross, ddx, ddy, degrees, determinant, distance, dot, exp, exp2, faceforward, floor, frac, frexp, fwidth, isinf, isnan, ldexp, length, lerp, log, log10, log2, mad, max, min, modf, mul, normalize, pow, radians, rcp, reflect, refract, round, rsqrt, saturate, sign, sin, sincos, sinh, smoothstep, sqrt, step, tan, tanh, transpose, trunc

In addition to these, ReShade FX provides a few additional ones:

 * ``float4 tex2D(sampler2D s, float2 coords)``  
 * ``float4 tex2D(sampler2D s, float2 coords, int2 offset)``  
 Samples a texture.\
 See also https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/direct3dhlsl/dx-graphics-hlsl-to-sample.
 * ``float4 tex2Dlod(sampler2D s, float4 coords)``  
 * ``float4 tex2Dlod(sampler2D s, float4 coords, int2 offset)``  
 Samples a texture on a specific mipmap level.\
 The accepted coordinates are in the form `float4(x, y, 0, lod)`.\
 See also https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/direct3dhlsl/dx-graphics-hlsl-to-samplelevel.
 * ``float4 tex2Dfetch(sampler2D s, int2 coords)``  
 * ``float4 tex2Dfetch(sampler2D s, int2 coords, int lod)``  
 * ``float4 tex2Dfetch(storage2D s, int2 coords)``  
 Fetches a value from the texture directly without any sampling.\
 See also https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3dhlsl/dx-graphics-hlsl-to-load.
 * ``float4 tex2DgatherR(sampler2D s, float2 coords)``  
 * ``float4 tex2DgatherR(sampler2D s, float2 coords, int2 offset)``  
 * ``float4 tex2DgatherG(sampler2D s, float2 coords)``  
 * ``float4 tex2DgatherG(sampler2D s, float2 coords, int2 offset)``  
 * ``float4 tex2DgatherB(sampler2D s, float2 coords)``  
 * ``float4 tex2DgatherB(sampler2D s, float2 coords, int2 offset)``  
 * ``float4 tex2DgatherA(sampler2D s, float2 coords)``  
 * ``float4 tex2DgatherA(sampler2D s, float2 coords, int2 offset)``  
 Gathers the specified component of the four neighboring pixels and returns the result.\
 `tex2DgatherR` for example is equivalent to https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/direct3dhlsl/texture2d-gatherred.  
 The return value is effectively:
 ```
 float4(tex2Dfetch(s, coords * tex2Dsize(s) + int2(0, 1)).comp,
        tex2Dfetch(s, coords * tex2Dsize(s) + int2(1, 1)).comp,
        tex2Dfetch(s, coords * tex2Dsize(s) + int2(0, 1)).comp,
        tex2Dfetch(s, coords * tex2Dsize(s) + int2(0, 0)).comp)
 ```
 * ``int2 tex2Dsize(sampler2D s)``  
 * ``int2 tex2Dsize(sampler2D s, int lod)``  
 * ``int2 tex2Dsize(storage2D s)``  
 Gets the texture dimensions of the specified mipmap level.\
 See also https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/direct3dhlsl/dx-graphics-hlsl-to-getdimensions
 * ``void tex2Dstore(storage2D s, int2 coords, float4 value)``

### Techniques

> An effect file can have multiple techniques, each representing a full render pipeline, which is executed to apply post-processing effects. ReShade executes all enabled techniques in the order they were defined in the effect file.
> A technique is made up of one or more passes which contain info about which render states to set and what shaders to execute. They are run sequentially starting with the top most declared. A name is optional.
> Each pass can set render states. The default value is used if one is not specified in the pass body.

Annotations:

 * ``technique Name < enabled = true; >``  
 Enable (or disable if false) this technique by default.
 * ``technique Name < timeout = 1000; >``  
 Auto-toggle this technique off 1000 milliseconds after it was enabled.\
 This can for example be used to have a technique run a single time only to do some initialization work, via ``technique Name < enabled = true; timeout = 1; >``
 * ``technique Name < toggle = 0x20; togglectrl = false; toggleshift = false; togglealt = false; >``  
 Toggle this technique when the specified key is pressed.
 * ``technique Name < hidden = true; >``  
 Hide this technique in the UI.
 * ``technique Name < ui_label = "My Effect Name"; >``  
 Uses a custom name for the technique in the UI.
 * ``technique Name < ui_tooltip = "My Effect description"; >``  
 Shows the specified text when the user hovers the technique in the UI.

```hlsl
