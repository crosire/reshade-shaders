    /* How this works:

        N frames before jitter wraps (8 here)
        M pixels (16x16 here)
        K samples per pixel

        total number of possible directions rays can have in a sqrt(M) sized box: 
        
            N * M * K

        To minimize noise, 2 things are important:

            1. each sample set (samples per pixel) must have unique sample locations over the N * M * K pool

                -> don't waste samples

            2. the sample sets must be evenly scattered over the N * M * K pool
              (e.g. for 1000 total samples, one pixel using sample 0 1 2 3 is bad but 0 250 644 899 is good)

                -> lower errors between pixels in uniform areas

        Ensuring the first is easy, just use a low discrepancy sequence
        Ensuring second one is more difficult - low discrepancy sequences tend to have this property 
        as well, but since we know the total sample count, use something that we know samples completely
        uniform over the N * M * K pool is better.

        Solution used here:

        Vogel spiral (golden angle)

        x(i) = sin(i * golden phi) * i / n
        y(i) = cos(i * golden phi) * i / n

        It has such properties and is also very easy to compute as opposed to some low discrepancy sequences
        which usually have a bigger overhead to compute each single sample, and also doesn't have to deal
        with big numbers if done right -> lower precision errors

        The trick is using a vogel spiral spanning all the N * M * K samples,
        in such a manner that each subset K (samples per pixel) is again a vogel spiral,
        and also that all K * N subsets are _again_ vogel spirals, does the trick.
        So each sample pattern of a pixel is a vogel spiral of a vogel spiral of a vogel spiral.
        The vogel properties of the smallest spiral are of not much relevance, as the spp rarely reach
        numbers where this is important.

        Given a vogel spiral of n points, some subsets(k, l) filled with points where n mod k == l
        have similar properties as the original vogel spiral and are thus ideal for this application.

        Using a 16x16 grid here -> M = 256
        Accumulating data of 8 frames here -> N = 8
