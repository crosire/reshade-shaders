/**
  Vibrance
  by Christian Cann Schuldt Jensen ~ CeeJay.dk
 
  Vibrance intelligently boosts the saturation of pixels so pixels that had little color get a larger boost than pixels that had a lot.
  This avoids oversaturation of pixels that were already very saturated.

  History:

  Version 1.0 by Ceejay.dk
  - Original 
  Version 1.1 by CeeJay.dk
  - Introduced RBG balance to help colorblind users
  Version 1.1.1
  - Minor UI improvements for Reshade 3.x
